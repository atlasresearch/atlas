Dr. Aliaga is a pioneer in the area of inverse procedural modeling for urban spaces, with his first paper introducing the topic in 2005 / 2007 . His vision is to facilitate semi-automatic and controllable content creation and edition of large and complex geometric models for use in digital simulation, visualization, entertainment, education, and cultural heritage by converting unstructured data into organized and easily editable procedural representations. While a significant benefit of procedural modeling is its detail amplification, it is very difficult to develop a compact expressive set of procedural rules. To this end, his group has innovated many automatic methods to infer procedural model rules and parameter values from 3D models, sketches, images, point clouds, roads, facades, buildings, cities, and vegetation. More recently, this approach now includes the use of various forms of deep generative modeling and is still an active area of research.

In each case, I was impressed when I heard the accomplishments of the recipients. I would tell myself that when I was more of a senior researcher, that maybe I would do something really significant that would qualify for this award. Then, after each conference I would go back to Purdue and continue working on some of my strange ideas. So, at first I was really quite surprised when I was informed that I had won this year's award. After all, I don't even feel all that senior! Then, as I thought more about it, I realized that I have been involved in information security and assurance as a practitioner, researcher, and educator for over 22 years. Maybe I'm a little more senior than I thought. (That might explain why I have to hold these papers at arm's length to read them!) After listening to that description of what I've done, I have to think that maybe I have done a few things that have made a difference. As security specialists, we spend an awful lot of time cleaning up after human error. And we also expend a great deal of effort performing research to develop technology that forces people to do the safe thing -- such as not be able to turn the security off. And yet, the people seem to find new ways to make things break and fail.","Professor Spafford has also been honored for his teaching, including receiving all three of Purdue's highest honors for the Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching Award in Memory of Charles B. Murphy , made a Fellow of the Purdue Teaching Academy , and listed in Purdue's Book of Great Teachers .

In each case, I was impressed when I heard the accomplishments of the recipients. I would tell myself that when I was more of a senior researcher, that maybe I would do something really significant that would qualify for this award. Then, after each conference I would go back to Purdue and continue working on some of my strange ideas. So, at first I was really quite surprised when I was informed that I had won this year's award. After all, I don't even feel all that senior! Then, as I thought more about it, I realized that I have been involved in information security and assurance as a practitioner, researcher, and educator for over 22 years. Maybe I'm a little more senior than I thought. (That might explain why I have to hold these papers at arm's length to read them!) After listening to that description of what I've done, I have to think that maybe I have done a few things that have made a difference. As security specialists, we spend an awful lot of time cleaning up after human error. And we also expend a great deal of effort performing research to develop technology that forces people to do the safe thing -- such as not be able to turn the security off. And yet, the people seem to find new ways to make things break and fail.","Professor Spafford has also been honored for his teaching, including receiving all three of Purdue's highest honors for the Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching Award in Memory of Charles B.

He is a member of ACM SIGGRAPH and ACM SIGGRAPH Pioneers, and has multiple times been Chair of Faculty Diversity for College of Science at Purdue. Dr. Aliaga is a pioneer in the area of inverse procedural modeling for urban spaces, with his first paper introducing the topic in 2005 / 2007 . His vision is to facilitate semi-automatic and controllable content creation and edition of large and complex geometric models for use in digital simulation, visualization, entertainment, education, and cultural heritage by converting unstructured data into organized and easily editable procedural representations. While a significant benefit of procedural modeling is its detail amplification, it is very difficult to develop a compact expressive set of procedural rules. To this end, his group has innovated many automatic methods to infer procedural model rules and parameter values from 3D models, sketches, images, point clouds, roads, facades, buildings, cities, and vegetation. More recently, this approach now includes the use of various forms of deep generative modeling and is still an active area of research.

In each case, I was impressed when I heard the accomplishments of the recipients. I would tell myself that when I was more of a senior researcher, that maybe I would do something really significant that would qualify for this award. Then, after each conference I would go back to Purdue and continue working on some of my strange ideas. So, at first I was really quite surprised when I was informed that I had won this year's award. After all, I don't even feel all that senior! Then, as I thought more about it, I realized that I have been involved in information security and assurance as a practitioner, researcher, and educator for over 22 years. Maybe I'm a little more senior than I thought. (That might explain why I have to hold these papers at arm's length to read them!) After listening to that description of what I've done, I have to think that maybe I have done a few things that have made a difference. As security specialists, we spend an awful lot of time cleaning up after human error. And we also expend a great deal of effort performing research to develop technology that forces people to do the safe thing -- such as not be able to turn the security off.
