He was honored with the Founder's Award by CISSE in 2001 and the IEEE Computer Society's Taylor L. Booth medal in 2003 for his contributions to information security education. Additionally, he received the ABACUS award from UPE in 2009 for his commitment to educational excellence.",Not specified,https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/spaf.html,Software Engineering

They have developed techniques for soft error resilience, concurrency bug detection, and system security, and are currently exploring energy-efficient intermittent computation and nonvolatile memory crash consistency. Previously an Assistant Professor at Virginia Tech, they now lead the CompArch research group at Purdue University, which emphasizes compiler-architecture cooperation. Their work has garnered several awards, including the NSF CAREER Award and induction into the MICRO Hall of Fame. Additionally, they have contributed to various academic committees and have a history of mentoring graduate students who have gone on to successful careers in industry and academia.",,Not specified,https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/chjung.html,Software Engineering
