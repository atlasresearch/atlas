Ultimately, our findings will enhance our understanding of goal-directed behaviors and contribute to improved treatments for neurological disorders such as ADHD and Parkinson's disease.",,Not specified,https://www.bio.purdue.edu/People/profile/spluta.html,Neurobiology

These proteins, including bacterial toxins and the human protein HYPE/FicD, can add AMP to RhoGTPases, leading to cellular signaling alterations that help bacteria evade immune responses. Recent findings also reveal that Fic proteins can utilize various nucleotides for modifications and have diverse roles in processes such as bacterial pathogenesis and eukaryotic cell signaling. The lab aims to identify specific substrates affected by Fic proteins, which may also provide new opportunities for vaccine and therapeutic development against bacterial infections.",,Not specified,https://www.bio.purdue.edu/People/profile/smattoo.html,Biochemistry
