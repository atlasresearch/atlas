Dr. Aliaga is a pioneer in the area of inverse procedural modeling for urban spaces, with his first paper introducing the topic in 2005 / 2007 . His vision is to facilitate semi-automatic and controllable content creation and edition of large and complex geometric models for use in digital simulation, visualization, entertainment, education, and cultural heritage by converting unstructured data into organized and easily editable procedural representations. While a significant benefit of procedural modeling is its detail amplification, it is very difficult to develop a compact expressive set of procedural rules. To this end, his group has innovated many automatic methods to infer procedural model rules and parameter values from 3D models, sketches, images, point clouds, roads, facades, buildings, cities, and vegetation. More recently, this approach now includes the use of various forms of deep generative modeling and is still an active area of research.

In each case, I was impressed when I heard the accomplishments of the recipients. I would tell myself that when I was more of a senior researcher, that maybe I would do something really significant that would qualify for this award. Then, after each conference I would go back to Purdue and continue working on some of my strange ideas. So, at first I was really quite surprised when I was informed that I had won this year's award. After all, I don't even feel all that senior! Then, as I thought more about it, I realized that I have been involved in information security and assurance as a practitioner, researcher, and educator for over 22 years. Maybe I'm a little more senior than I thought. (That might explain why I have to hold these papers at arm's length to read them!) After listening to that description of what I've done, I have to think that maybe I have done a few things that have made a difference. As security specialists, we spend an awful lot of time cleaning up after human error. And we also expend a great deal of effort performing research to develop technology that forces people to do the safe thing -- such as not be able to turn the security off. And yet, the people seem to find new ways to make things break and fail.","Professor Spafford has also been honored for his teaching, including receiving all three of Purdue's highest honors for the Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching Award in Memory of Charles B. Murphy , made a Fellow of the Purdue Teaching Academy , and listed in Purdue's Book of Great Teachers .

In each case, I was impressed when I heard the accomplishments of the recipients. I would tell myself that when I was more of a senior researcher, that maybe I would do something really significant that would qualify for this award. Then, after each conference I would go back to Purdue and continue working on some of my strange ideas. So, at first I was really quite surprised when I was informed that I had won this year's award. After all, I don't even feel all that senior! Then, as I thought more about it, I realized that I have been involved in information security and assurance as a practitioner, researcher, and educator for over 22 years. Maybe I'm a little more senior than I thought. (That might explain why I have to hold these papers at arm's length to read them!) After listening to that description of what I've done, I have to think that maybe I have done a few things that have made a difference. As security specialists, we spend an awful lot of time cleaning up after human error. And we also expend a great deal of effort performing research to develop technology that forces people to do the safe thing -- such as not be able to turn the security off. And yet, the people seem to find new ways to make things break and fail.","Professor Spafford has also been honored for his teaching, including receiving all three of Purdue's highest honors for the Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching Award in Memory of Charles B.

He is a member of ACM SIGGRAPH and ACM SIGGRAPH Pioneers, and has multiple times been Chair of Faculty Diversity for College of Science at Purdue. Dr. Aliaga is a pioneer in the area of inverse procedural modeling for urban spaces, with his first paper introducing the topic in 2005 / 2007 . His vision is to facilitate semi-automatic and controllable content creation and edition of large and complex geometric models for use in digital simulation, visualization, entertainment, education, and cultural heritage by converting unstructured data into organized and easily editable procedural representations. While a significant benefit of procedural modeling is its detail amplification, it is very difficult to develop a compact expressive set of procedural rules. To this end, his group has innovated many automatic methods to infer procedural model rules and parameter values from 3D models, sketches, images, point clouds, roads, facades, buildings, cities, and vegetation. More recently, this approach now includes the use of various forms of deep generative modeling and is still an active area of research. Dr. Aliaga has published surveys, given talks and tutorials (e.g., at SIGGRAPH, CVPR and Eurographics) on this topic.",,Not specified,https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/aliaga.html,Robotics and Computer Vision

In each case, I was impressed when I heard the accomplishments of the recipients. I would tell myself that when I was more of a senior researcher, that maybe I would do something really significant that would qualify for this award. Then, after each conference I would go back to Purdue and continue working on some of my strange ideas. So, at first I was really quite surprised when I was informed that I had won this year's award. After all, I don't even feel all that senior! Then, as I thought more about it, I realized that I have been involved in information security and assurance as a practitioner, researcher, and educator for over 22 years. Maybe I'm a little more senior than I thought. (That might explain why I have to hold these papers at arm's length to read them!) After listening to that description of what I've done, I have to think that maybe I have done a few things that have made a difference. As security specialists, we spend an awful lot of time cleaning up after human error. And we also expend a great deal of effort performing research to develop technology that forces people to do the safe thing -- such as not be able to turn the security off.

This organizational process is largely carried out by the adaptive immune system with CD4 + T helper (Th) cells acting to trigger inflammation during infection and also suppress unwanted immune responses to non-harmful stimuli (i.e. allergens, food or normal body microflora). The dual nature (i.e. activator and suppressor) of Th cells is possible due to their unique ability to sense the environment and change their function based on these environmental cues. Autoimmune disease occurs when the balance between the inflammatory and regulatory functions of Th cells is disrupted, resulting in excess inflammation that alters physiological processes. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are two forms of intestinal autoimmune disease and are characterized by the accumulation of highly reactive inflammatory T cells in the intestines. However, the exact mechanisms by which inflammatory Th cells arise during inflammation and cause disease are unclear. In the Olson lab, our goal is to better understand how CD4 + T helper cells drive intestinal inflammation by addressing these key questions: What signals drive the generation of pathogenic/inflammatory Th cells in the intestines? How do pathogenic/inflammatory T helper cells contribute to disease? Can we therapeutically target factors that drive the generation of pathogenic T helper cells or their functional byproducts to eliminate or reduce disease? My laboratory uses a combination of cell and molecular biology approaches to examine signaling pathways associated with T helper cell differentiation. We also utilize pre-clinical models of disease, and high throughput culturing and RNA/protein profiling techniques to identify disease mechanisms and novel mediators of inflammation.

BIO Lab website The main interest of the Mesecar lab is the Structure & Function of Enzymes of biomedical importance. One of our fundamental goals is to gain a deeper understanding of the roles these enzymes play in the disease process and how these enzymes recognize and catalyze the transformation of their substrates into products. By understanding enzymesâ molecular recognition processes and their kinetic, chemical, structural and regulatory mechanisms, we can then exploit this knowledge for the discovery, design and development of small molecule drugs. We are currently studying the structure and function of enzymes involved in promoting cancer, coronavirus infections and Alzheimerâs disease. Due to the complex nature of enzymatic catalysis and molecular recognition, we routinely use a variety of state-of-the-art experimental approaches and tools from the fields of chemistry, biology and physics. Our main experimental tools are static and time-resolved X-ray crystallography, enzyme chemistry & kinetics, molecular biology, mass-spec proteomics, assay development and optimization, high-throughput screening and molecular modeling, cheminformatics and cryo-EM. Our multi-faceted, multi-disciplinary, collaborative and integrated approach to the elucidation of the nature of enzymatic catalysis and molecular recognition is the model for scientific investigation and education in the twenty-first century.

I am interested in elucidating how neuromodulatory systems induce reward-dependent plasticity of the neural circuits involved in visual perception. I use a multi-disciplinary approach: using optogenetics and robotics to map neural circuits in vitro, and extra- and intracellular electrophysiological recordings in vivo. I use the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) as a model system, as it combines the ease of manipulating visual stimulus with accessibility for in vivo recordings in a genetically tractable animal model. This combination of in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology with the optogenetic tools provides an integrated platform to dissect and manipulate specific circuits relevant for visual perception, and study diseases affecting perception and neural circuit function, such as autism.

Towards addressing this knowledge gap, the overarching goals of our research program are to: 1) better understand the relationship between obesity and breast cancer incidence and aggressiveness, 2) determine the influence and mechanisms of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin on breast cancer formation and progression and 3) determine the mechanisms of natural products and exercise in breast development and breast cancer prevention.Â In our work, we exploit cell culture and animal models combined with emerging biochemical methods, informatics tools and advanced imaging technologies to define tumor architecture and identify novel biomarkers, proteomic, genomic and metabolomic signatures associated with tumor progression. These efforts can provide valuable insights into the mechanistic links between obesity, leptin and breast tumorigenesis that serve as a foundation for the development of novel breast cancer therapeutic strategies.

Stanton Gelvin,gelvin@purdue.edu,Biology,,"['Biophysics', 'Cell Biology', 'Computational Biology']","['Biophysics', 'Physics', 'Biology']","Our research investigates how a soil bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens , genetically engineers plants. Agrobacterium transfers a piece of bacterial DNA, the T-(transferred) DNA, to wounded plant cells where it makes its way through the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, T-DNA integrates into the host genome and expresses genes. Under normal circumstances, these genes cause the disease Crown Gall on plants. However, scientists have learned to manipulate T-DNA, replacing disease genes with genes of benefit to the plant. Many genetically engineered crop plants with desirable traits (disease resistance, herbicide tolerance, and enhanced nutritional value) were generated using Agrobacterium . Unfortunately, many important crop plants, including those important to Indiana farmers (corn, soybeans, and wheat) remain highly recalcitrant to Agrobacterium -mediated genetic transformation. Our research focuses on understanding the role of plant genes and proteins in this natural genetic engineering process. We have identified plant genes involved in bacterial attachment to plant cells, T-DNA and Virulence transfer to and cytoplasmic trafficking within plants , T-DNA nuclear targeting, and T-DNA integration. Recently, we have been able to manipulate some of these genes to improve Agrobacterium transformation efficiency. We are currently working with agricultural biotechnology companies to improve the genetic engineering of crops, including those important for Indianas economy. January 28-March 30, 2018.

Daoguo Zhou,zhoud@purdue.edu,Biology,,"['Biophysics', 'Cell Biology', 'Computational Biology']","['Biophysics', 'Physics', 'Biology']","Pathogenic Salmonella strains cause food poisoning, gastrointestinal inflammation, typhoid fever, and septicemia in humans. The bacteria achieve this by making a panel of specialized proteins that allows it to invade non-phagocytic intestinal epithelial cells, the first step in the disease process. Previous research has established that upon contact with the intestinal epithelial cells, Salmonella injects a set of proteins into the host cells through the bacterially encoded type III protein secretion system. These proteins subvert host cell signal transduction pathways to induce profuse actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and membrane ruffling, leading to the uptake of the bacterium. This uptake process is a highly regulated event and requires the coordinated action of the injected bacterial proteins as well as host proteins. My laboratory is interested in identifying and characterizing bacterial and host cellular proteins that are involved in Salmonella -induced actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, especially cellular proteins whose activities are modulated by Salmonella proteins. Studying the interaction between bacteria and their hosts has emerged as one of the most exciting areas of cellular microbiology. It will not only broaden our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis, but also will provide unexpected insights into basic host cellular functions, such as the cytoskeletal rearrangements and signal transduction pathways controlling cell movement.",,Not specified,https://www.bio.purdue.edu/People/profile/zhoud.html,Not found

BIO My lab has focused on pattern formation and differentiation in the developing Drosophila compound eye. The ability to manipulate fly eyes using genetic, molecular and cellular tools has made them a valuable model system for the dissection of highly conserved developmental pathways. During pattern formation, an initially unpatterned epithelium is transformed into reiterated clusters of 8 photoreceptors, future unit eyes or ommatidia, surrounded by a precise network of supporting cells. Upon completion of pattern formation, when all retinal cells have been allotted their fate and established their appropriate, specific cell-cell contacts, differentiation begins. Most spectacularly, photoreceptors undergo enormous growth and build a rod-like photosensitive membrane organelle, the rhabdomere. Supporting cells likewise execute specific differentiative programs to build lenses and shape ommatidia to their function. In addition to optically insulating ommatidia, the hexagonal network of inter-ommatidial pigment cells plays a critical role in aligning rhabdomeres to the unit eyeâs optical axis and aligning the eyeâs photoreceptor array to give the fly its panoramic view, which makes them so hard to catch. In collaboration with Dr. Henry Chang, Dept. of Biological Sciences, my current focus is how intercellular calcium waves, the actomyosin cytoskeleton, and extracellular matrix cooperate in compound eye morphogenesis. Left : Ready, Hanson and Benzer (1976), Fig. 7, shows an eye-antennal disc. Mature photoreceptor clusters form a square array at the posterior of the eye disc (left and inset). Anterior to the clusters, a vertical dark line, the morphogenetic furrow, marks the onset of pattern formation. Right : Ready and Chang (2021), Video-5, shows time lapse GCaMP6 imaging of calcium waves in the developing retinal epithelium. To the left, posterior, waves sweep across the grid of supporting cells surrounding developing photoreceptor clusters. Right of center, the bright, vertical band of activity marks the morphogenetic furrow. http://movie.biologists.com/vi... Top left : Jan Swammerdam (1650). Honeybee eye dissection. Ommatidia, tapered hexagonal prisms, stand on a perforated, domed retinal floor (yellow). Top right and bottom : Ready and Chang (2021), Fig. 1. A. Actin-rich, photosensitive rhabdomeres, boxed, extend from the outer, corneal surface of the eye to the retinal floor (yellow), a cytoskeletal/ECM assembly shaped by Actin (red) and Collagen IV/Viking (green). C. The retinal floor viewed from above (left panel), side (middle panel), and below (right panel). Actin stress fibers (SF) in inter-ommatidial cell endfeet anchor to neighboring grommets, ECM perforations via which ommatidial axons exit the retina, and pull them towards each other, contracting the floor fourfold and imposing a taper upon overlying ommatidia. A hexagonal network of Collagen IV ridges resists compression. A balance of actomyosin contraction and Collagen IV stiffness shapes the curvature of the retinal floor, aligning ommatidia to the eyeâs panoramic view. Intercellular calcium waves coordinate stress fiber contraction across the eye.

We use Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires disease as a model organism. One essential pathogenic factor of this bacterium is the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system that injects approximately 300 virulence proteins (effectors) into host cells to create a niche permissive for bacterial replication. One focus of our research is to determine the function of these proteins and their roles in bacterial infection. The second focus is to examine the mechanism of the detection and response of immune cells to intracellular pathogens, particularly the signaling pathway involved in the detection of the bacterial ribosomal protein RpsL that triggers lysosomal cell death. Finally, we are interested in study the function of Fic proteins found in diverse bacteria. The long term goal of these studies is to elucidate the signal transduction pathways important for bacterial virulence, immune detection and other events important for the establishment of successful infection, such information will be invaluable not only in combating infectious diseases but also in our understanding of cell signaling in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

I have been teaching biology-related courses at all levels for over the past 10 years. My work as an educator has included developing Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) where students are involved in the entire research process and complete authentic research experiences as early as their first year in college during their laboratory courses. By answering questions that are unknown and relevant, student work produced within CURE labs is valuable beyond the classroom. These projects have led to undergraduate students first-author research publications and publications of educational methodologies. I also focus on pedagogical developments that help promote student learning in the classroom including using alternative grading strategies. These CUREs and alternative grading strategies are a major part of my Biology Education Research, where I ask questions about the long-term impacts of these implementations, the perceptions of students and their instructors, and measuring students' sense of belonging in science and their intrinsic motivation. I am very excited to assist Purdue students as they discover their place in the biological sciences. I help teach Biol 135, the first-year biology majors laboratory, where students complete an authentic team research project.

Research in the Mattoo lab focuses on a newly discovered family of evolutionarily conserved proteins that are defined by the presence of a âFic domainâ .Â These Fic proteins utilize nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives to post-translationally modify their substrates, thereby altering cellular signaling.Â Specifically, in 2009, we and others reported that bacterial toxins containing the Fic domain could utilize ATP to add an AMP (adenosine mono-phosphate) to RhoGTPases 1,2 .Â This adenylylation event (sometimes called AMPylation 2 ) inactivates RhoGTPases, thereby inducing host cytoskeletal collapse.Â As such, Fic-mediated adenylylation allows the bacteria to evade phagocytosis by immune cells and/or breach the hostâs protective cellular barriers 2,3 . We further demonstrated that the only human Fic domain-containing protein, HYPE/FicD, also has the ability to add AMP to RhoGTPases in vitro , but HYPEâs physiological target remains to be identified 1 .Â We have since shown that other nucleotides, such as GTP, CTP, and UTP, can also be utilized for Fic-mediated modifications 4 .Â Most recently, another bacterial Fic protein implicated in golgi breakdown and disruption of host vesicular trafficking was shown to hydrolyze a CTP derivative, called CDP-choline, to transfer not the nucleotide moiety but rather the phospho-choline to RabGTPases 5 .Â Thus, the Fic domain confers both nucleotidyl transferase as well as phospho-choline transferase activity. The goal of the Mattoo lab is to explore the role of Fic proteins in regulating prokaryotic and eukaryotic signal transduction events. Our initial findings on Fic-mediated adenylylation were well received by the scientific community, being featured in the âEditorâs Choiceâ section in Science Magazine, the âResearch Highlightsâ section of Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology , the âSpotlightâ section in Infection and Immunity , and receiving a 9.0 score by the Faculty of 1000, indicating the wide interest in this new field.Â With over 5000 family members, Fic proteins have been implicated in processes as diverse as bacterial pathogenesis, cell division, protein translation, eukaryotic cell signaling, and cellular trafficking. Our goal is to identify substrates targeted for modification in these biological processes.Â Interestingly, an antibody directed against the Fic domain is protective against bacterial infection 6,7 .Â Thus, Fic proteins also offer a new avenue for design of vaccines and disease therapeutics .",,Not specified,https://www.bio.purdue.edu/People/profile/smattoo.html,Not found

Our enthusiasm for scientific research comes from a desire to have a global view of protein folding; the relationship between protein function, sequence, and structure; and evolution of protein families, pathways, and organisms. Now complete genome sequences of more than 210 organisms are available in public databases. Using these genome data, we can directly investigate evolution of organisms/protein families, gene transfer, or mechanism of coding principle of pathways in a genome. Linking protein tertiary structure information which comes from both experimental data and prediction will add another important aspect in our understanding.

By âreplaying the tape of lifeâ and placing these ancient regulatory changes within a framework of âwhat might have beenâ, Brianâs research determines not only the historical genetic basis for new molecular functions, but also the broader genetic mechanisms underlying how those functions emerged and have evolved.",,Not specified,https://www.bio.purdue.edu/People/profile/bphm.html,Not found

BIO My lab applies x-ray crystallography and molecular biology to systems where proteins work together in membranes to perform a biological function. Cholesterol production in humans begins with the activity of the membrane-associated enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase. We determined the structure of a bacterial analogue of this enzyme. Insights into the mechanisms of activation and inhibition have been gained by also determining the structure in the presence of substrates and the cholesterol-lowering drug Lovastatin, and lead to the possibility for design of new drugs to lower cholesterol. ABC-transporters are ubiquitous membrane protein transport systems and include medically important molecules involved in multidrug resistance and cystic fibrosis. We have solved the atomic structure of a portion of one of these proteins. An examination of the complexes with substrates suggests a unique mechanism that links the energy from ATP cleavage with the physical opening and closing of a protein pore through the membrane. Some proteins we study are soluble, but have their effect at a membrane surface. An example is a pathogenic bacterium's toxin that specifically binds to the surface of immune cells and stimulates them to grow and divide. By analyzing the structure of both wild type and mutant toxins, we have determined how the critical portions of the toxin protein interact with receptors on the immune cells.

Catherine Searle,searlec@purdue.edu,Biology,,"['Biophysics', 'Computational Biology', 'Ecology']","['Biophysics', 'Physics', 'Biology']","I am a disease ecologist studying the effects of species composition and community structure on infectious diseases. In natural systems, disease dynamics can be altered in a variety of ways as communities lose species (e.g. from habitat loss, pollution, etc.), gain species (e.g. from species invasions), or experience changes to population sizes and intraspecific diversity. These factors can influence the frequency and severity of disease outbreaks. To understand these processes, I combine field observations with experimental manipulations in the field, mesocosm and laboratory. My primary host systems are freshwater zooplankton ( Daphnia ) and amphibians (with a focus on chytridiomycosis). Through these studies, I aim to understand how changes global to biodiversity are altering disease dynamics.
