Stanton Gelvin,gelvin@purdue.edu,Biology,,"['Biophysics', 'Cell Biology', 'Computational Biology']","['Biophysics', 'Physics', 'Biology']","The research focuses on the genetic engineering of plants using the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which transfers T-DNA to plant cells, integrating it into the host genome. While this process can cause disease, scientists have learned to replace harmful genes with beneficial ones, leading to genetically engineered crops with improved traits. However, many important crops remain resistant to this transformation method. The team is investigating plant genes and proteins that facilitate T-DNA transfer and integration, aiming to enhance transformation efficiency and collaborate with agricultural biotechnology companies to improve crop genetic engineering. Throughout their research, they have presented findings at various international conferences and seminars.",,Not specified,https://www.bio.purdue.edu/People/profile/gelvin.html,Plant Biology
