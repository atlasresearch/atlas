Ximena Bernal,xbernal@purdue.edu,Biology,N/A,"Our research group investigates two interconnected ecological topics: the influence of natural enemies on animal communication systems and the effects of human activities on these networks. We focus on anurans (frogs and toads) and their predators, such as frog-biting midges and frog-eating bats, to explore how eavesdropping impacts communication. Given their vocal behavior and ecological significance, frogs serve as an ideal model for studying signal function and evolution. Additionally, we aim to understand how anthropogenic factors like traffic noise and habitat fragmentation affect these threatened species.","['Biophysics', 'Computational Biology', 'Ecology']","['Biophysics', 'Physics', 'Biology']",Not specified,Ecology,https://www.bio.purdue.edu/People/profile/xbernal.html
