Scott Pluta,spluta@purdue.edu,Biology,N/A,"My lab investigates the neural mechanisms of sensory perception, behavior, and sensorimotor loops using advanced techniques like optogenetics and neurophysiology. We focus on how higher brain regions influence the activity of the superior colliculus (SC) and its connection to behavior, employing targeted labeling and optical manipulation of cortical neurons. Our research aims to understand the significance of signals from the SC to thalamic and cortical circuits, ultimately providing insights into goal-directed behaviors and potential treatments for neurological disorders such as ADHD and Parkinson's disease.","['Biophysics', 'Computational Biology', 'Ecology']","['Biophysics', 'Physics', 'Biology']",Not specified,Neurobiology,https://www.bio.purdue.edu/People/profile/spluta.html
R. Claudio Aguilar,claudio@purdue.edu,Biology,N/A,"The laboratory focuses on protein trafficking and membrane transport, particularly in relation to cell polarity establishment, which is essential for animal development and physiological functions like synaptic transmission and immune response. Research employs genetic, biochemical, and cell biology techniques using yeast and mammalian cells.

Stephanie Gardner,sgardne@purdue.edu,Biology,N/A,"The research group focuses on enhancing undergraduate students' engagement in scientific practices, critical thinking, and data visualization in biology. Current projects include improving students' skills in analyzing biological data, mechanistic reasoning, and evidentiary reasoning, as well as understanding their conceptions of scientific inquiry. The group emphasizes active student participation in laboratory courses, where students design and execute experiments, fostering scientific reasoning and practical skills. Additionally, the instructor teaches physiology courses and collaborates with faculty on Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) initiatives to integrate research questions into the curriculum. Data collected from these efforts aim to inform and improve teaching methodologies in biology education.","['Biophysics', 'Computational Biology', 'Ecology']","['Biophysics', 'Physics', 'Biology']",Not specified,Not found,https://www.bio.purdue.edu/People/profile/sgardne.html
Daoguo Zhou,zhoud@purdue.edu,Biology,N/A,"The ZHOU Lab's Motility Group focuses on the pathogenic mechanisms of Salmonella strains, which cause various illnesses in humans by invading intestinal epithelial cells. This invasion is facilitated by specialized proteins injected into host cells via a type III protein secretion system, leading to significant actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and membrane ruffling. The lab aims to identify and characterize both bacterial and host proteins involved in these processes, enhancing our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis and offering insights into fundamental host cellular functions related to movement and signaling.","['Biophysics', 'Cell Biology', 'Computational Biology']","['Biophysics', 'Physics', 'Biology']",Not specified,Microbiology,https://www.bio.purdue.edu/People/profile/zhoud.html
